# Titanic data analysis

I'm currently taking the "Data Scientist Foundation I" course in Udacity 
(["*Fundamentos de Data Science I*"](https://br.udacity.com/course/fundamentos-data-science-i-python--nd110) in its original Brazilian Portuguese title).

For the final project, I have to analyze [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) data from Titanic passengers using Pandas, Numpy 
and Matplotlib. The .csv file with the relevant data is in [`titanic-data-6.csv`](https://github.com/pedrohasantiago/udacity-titanic/blob/master/titanic-data-6.csv).
In the analysis I have to answer different questions regarding at least three single-variable (1d) and one multiple-variable (2d) explorations.

The questions I decided to answer and all the analysis I made can be seen in Portuguese in the Jupyter Notebook [`analysis-report.ipynb`](https://github.com/pedrohasantiago/udacity-titanic/blob/master/analysis-report.ipynb). There's also an [`.HTML version`](https://github.com/pedrohasantiago/udacity-titanic/blob/master/analysis-report.html). I will make an 
English translation as soon as possible.

In [`resources-list.txt`](https://github.com/pedrohasantiago/udacity-titanic/blob/master/resources-list.txt) there is a list of links I checked during the project (mainly Stack Overflow links). This was a requirement for the 
project.
